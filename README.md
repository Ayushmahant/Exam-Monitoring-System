# Exam Monitoring System (EMS)
 
 The Automatic Question Paper Generation System is a web-based application that automates the process of generating question papers for college exams based on the predefined exam pattern. The system ensures that questions are not repeated, and it includes a secure two-factor authentication and encryption scheme to protect user accounts. The current version of the project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java, and MySQL technologies. In the future, the project aims to implement machine learning to allow the system to generate questions on its own without relying on a predefined question bank.

Key Features:

1.User Authentication: The system provides secure user authentication with a two-factor authentication scheme, adding an extra layer of security to user accounts.

2.Admin Dashboard: An admin dashboard allows authorized users to set up the exam pattern, define subject-wise question distribution, and specify the difficulty levels.

3.Question Bank Management: The system includes a question bank management module where authorized administrators can add, edit, or remove questions from the database. Each question is tagged with metadata such as subject, topic, and difficulty level.

4.Exam Pattern Configuration: The admin can define the exam pattern for each subject, including the number of sections, types of questions, marks distribution, and time limits.

5.Automatic Question Paper Generation: Based on the defined exam pattern and question bank, the system intelligently selects questions to generate a unique question paper for each exam. The system ensures that questions are not repeated across different exams.

6.Randomization: The system randomizes the order of questions and, if applicable, randomizes the options for multiple-choice questions to prevent cheating.

7.Question Format Customization: The system supports various question formats, such as multiple-choice, short answer, and essay questions. Admins can customize question formats for different subjects.

8.Result and Feedback: After the exam, students can access their results, and there's an option to provide feedback on the question paper.

9.Machine Learning Integration (Future Enhancement): In the future, the project aims to implement machine learning algorithms to automatically generate questions. The system will learn from existing questions and use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create new questions.

10.Scalability and Performance: The application is designed to handle a large number of users and questions efficiently. Caching mechanisms are implemented to improve performance.

11.Security and Privacy: The project prioritizes security, including data encryption, secure authentication, and access controls to protect user data and question bank information.

12.User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for professors and administrators to navigate and set up exams.


The Automatic Question Paper Generation System aims to streamline the process of creating customized question papers for college exams, ensuring fairness, uniqueness, and adherence to the predefined exam pattern. With the integration of machine learning in the future, the system will take a step further by generating questions autonomously, reducing the need for a predefined question bank.
